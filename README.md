# Mad Libs story

## Problem Description
Your task is to create a "Mad Libs" style story. For those of you unfamiliar with these, you will write a short story (about paragraph). You will then choose some words that will be filled in by the user, who wonâ€™t know what the story says. The program will take the user-supplied words and put them in the story, usually with funny results. 

## Steps to take
1) Write your story in the space below.
2) Select the words that will be missing in the program and will be supplied by the user. (You can circle, highlight, underline or strike through them above.)
3) Determine the part of speech of each word (such as noun, proper noun, verb (include tense if needed), adverb, adjective).
4) Write the introduction to the user. (This should display on the screen when the program runs to tell the user what is happening.)
5) Prompt the user for each word.
6) Print (display) your story.
7) Test your program. You can test it yourself or you can have a friend or relative play.




Once upon a time in a far away land a man found an abandoned castle. He named the castle fisherman's warf. The problem was, the castle was built in the space between the earth and the ocean. It had begun slowly sinking into the sand, slowly, until it eventually hit the next layer of the world, and so could move no further. Now, the old man was very sad because he now had no house and so would have nowhere to live. The man decided that to fix this problem, he would build a small town on top of the castle. People would come there from all over to visit the space between land and sea. He named the place Fisherman's Wharf after his sunken castle. And that, is how the city of San Francisco began.
